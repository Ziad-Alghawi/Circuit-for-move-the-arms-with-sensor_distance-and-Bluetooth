# Circuit-for-sensor-distance-

First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

Two The Breadboard small

Two Arduino UNO R3

Six Micro servo Motors

Ultrasonic Distance sensor

Tow LEDs

Two Resistors 

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

Then I wrote code for turn on the led and servo motor if the sensor find something near from him 100 cm or less .
