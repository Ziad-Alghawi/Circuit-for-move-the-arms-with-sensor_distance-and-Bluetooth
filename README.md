# Circuit-for-sensor-distance-

First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

The Breadboard small

Arduino UNO R3

One Micro servo Motor

Ultrasonic Distance sensor

LED

Resistor 

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

Then I wrote code for turn on the led and servo motor if the sensor find something near from him 100 cm or less .
