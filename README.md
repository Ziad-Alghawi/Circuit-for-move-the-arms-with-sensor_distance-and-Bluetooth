# Circuit-for-sensor-distance-

First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

Two The Breadboard small

Two Arduino UNO R3

Six Micro servo Motors

Ultrasonic Distance sensor

Tow LEDs

Two Resistors 

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

Then I wrote code for turn on the green led and servo motors if the sensor find something near from him 100 cm or less .
and if something far more than 100 cm in this case the red led will be turn on and the motors will be back to sleep mode .

Additionally, Bluooth will send signal to the ipad device for open the Welcome screen .
